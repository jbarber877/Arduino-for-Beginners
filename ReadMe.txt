Activity 2
Make an LED fade in and out

Activity 3
Power on an LED when the button is pushed

Activity 4
Add multiple LEDs to your project

Activity 5
Use a button to toggle LEDs on and off. If the button is on, the yellow led is on. 
Else, red and green LED are on.

Activity 7
Improve the previous project using functions and arrays to toggle LEDs on/off using a button

Activity 8
Practice using the serial function to set the rate for an LED to blink

Activity 9 LED Controls
Practice using different components to control LEDs

LED 1 - Use serial input to toggle LED on/off for a variable amount of time
LED 2 - Set brightness of LED using input from potentiometer
LED 3 - Toggle LED on/off using a button 

Activity 10
Improve LED functionality by replacing the delay() function with millis()

Asignment 11
Address the 'button bounce' problem by setting a time delay when the button is pressed.
If the button is pressed, toggle LED2 and LED3 on/off. Also, blink LED1 every 1 second.

Activity 12
Practice using interrupts by counting the number of times a button is pressed and printing to the console

Activity 14
Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance to an object

Activity 15
Practice using interrupts to measure distances with an ultrasonic sensor. Light up the
corresponding LED based on the distance. If the nearest obstacle is > 100 cm away, blue;
if obstacle is > 15 cm and < 100 cm away, green; if obstacle is < 15 cm away, red.

Activity 16
Practice using the LCD to read from Serial Monitor and print to the LCD screen.
Printing should alternate between top and bottom rows.
Input should not be more than 16 characters long.

Activity 17
Practice using an ultrasonic sensor and LCD. Print the distance from an obstacle in front of the sensor to the LCD.

 Activity 18 
Practice using IR remote to control different circuit components and an LCD screen to monitor
outputs. Buttons 1, 2, and 3 should toggle the LEDs on pins 12, 11, and 10 on/off. Button 0
turns off all LEDs, FUNC/STOP clears the LCD display.

Activity 19 Photoresistor
Use a photoresistor to control an LED

Activity 20
Compute the average brightness in the area over a period of time (5 seconds).
This should be done using an array, NOT a running sum.
